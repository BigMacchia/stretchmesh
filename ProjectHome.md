StretchMesh is a plug-in for Autodesk Maya which gives geometry an inherently stretchy characteristic. As geometry is deformed using native Maya deformers or other plug-ins, StretchMesh gives the geometry a built-in stretchy quality by preserving the relationship between vertices. Collision objects can be added to simulate the underlying anatomy over which the skin slides. A "stiffness" map can be painted to accommodate areas where stretchiness is not desired.
